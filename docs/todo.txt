Current todo:
- Refactor for better readability (whole pj)

- Refactor: change <React.Fragment> to <>
- Refactor: props.children allows to nest inside component (dont need to make 'content' prop)

- Refactor: if outside of component, its not updated on each re-render, move as much as possible
- Refactor: any computations that are not needed on each component re-render move outside of the component
- Refactor: useMemo for stuff like scale functions or any calc. functions from d3
    JSX can also be memoized

- add axis names
- unslugify fields in the Table
- fix buggy hover on BarText
- add email and creation date to the report

- Reports:
    Viz:
        for each Chart choose between Bar/Pie
        ability to choose for which region to show the data(globally, not for individual chart)
        ability to turn on/off each chart
        finish grid marking(without actual implementation)

        - Needed graphs:
